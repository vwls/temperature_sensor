# temperature_sensor

Temperature management is essential for healthy fermentation! I made this data logger to take temperature readings in my kitchen every minute and log them to a .csv file locally (on the raspberry pi) to better inform where I should position my sake operation. 

Thanks to Kevin M for the python script.
